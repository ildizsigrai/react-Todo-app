# React Todo App
A simple todo list application built using React and Material-UI.

# Features
- Add new todos to the list.
- Toggle the completion status of todos.
- Remove todos from the list.
- Persist todo data in local storage.
- Stylish and responsive design using Material-UI components.

# Usage
- Add a new todo by typing text in the input field and pressing Enter or clicking the "Add" button.
- Mark todos as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each todo.
- Remove a todo by clicking the delete icon next to it.
- Your todo list is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so your todos will persist even after you close the browser.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
